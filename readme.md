# Remix.js FullStack Framework

![Remix - Build Better Websites](https://remix.run/img/og.1.jpg)

Remix.js is a full-stack framework that provides server-side rendering for web applications. Unlike static site generation, Remix.js prerenders all components and sends the finished page to the browser. This approach requires a hosting environment that supports server-side code execution.

## File-based Routing System

Remix.js follows a file-based routing system similar to Next.js. Each page or route in the application is represented by a corresponding file. For example, to create a route for "/about", you would create an "about.jsx" file.

## Client-side Routing

Remix.js allows you to perform client-side routing using the `Link` component from `@remix-run/react`. By using the `Link` component, you can navigate between different pages within your Remix.js application.

To link a CSS stylesheet, you can go to the "root.jsx" file and export a function called `links()`. This function should return an array of objects, with each object containing the `rel` and `href` properties for the stylesheet. This array of objects can be imported into any page to include the necessary styles.

## Surfacing Styles

To export component styles in the component code, you can include them as part of the component's export statement. When you import this component in a page, you can also export the `cssLinkFunction` and spread its value in the main page's `links()` function. This ensures that the component's styles are included when the page is rendered.

## Form Submission

Form submission in Remix.js works with the `action` and `method` functions. You can export a server-side function called `action({ request })`, where `request.formData()` contains the form data. This allows you to process form submissions on the server.

Alternatively, you can use the `Form` component from `remix-run/react`. This component prevents the page from reloading on form submission while maintaining the necessary functionality.

## Data Fetching

Remix.js provides a convenient way to fetch data during page loading. You can create a function called `loader` and export it. This function is used to fetch data whenever the page is loaded (i.e., a GET request). You can then use the `useLoaderData` hook to access the data returned from the `loader` function.

Remix.js ensures that the page is only shown after the data has been loaded, eliminating the need for an explicit loader.

## Error Handling

Remix.js allows you to handle errors and display custom error pages. You can use the `export function ErrorBoundary({ error })` function in the `root.jsx` file or any other page of your choice. This function should return the error page to be displayed.

When an error is thrown in your application, the `ErrorBoundary` will handle it. If a response is thrown instead of an error, the `CatchBoundary` will be used.

You can use the `useCatch` function to retrieve the error response in your `CatchBoundary` function and display the appropriate error message.

## Dynamic Routing

For dynamic routing, you can add a file named `notes.$id.jsx` to your routes, where `$id` will be replaced by the actual ID value. For example, if you want to load something like "notes/note-1", the file name should be `notes.$id.jsx`.

You can access the parameters in the `loader` and `action` functions through the object passed as a parameter.

## Metadata

To add metadata to a specific page, you can export a function called `meta()` in that page. This function allows you to define metadata such as page title, description, and other relevant information.
